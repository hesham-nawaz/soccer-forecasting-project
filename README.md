# Soccer Forecasting

Soccer games can have 1 of 3 outcomes:
- Home team wins
- Draw
- Away team wins

This project aims to create an open-source prediction tool for soccer games.

Section 1: Introduction and Problem Formulation

Predicting the outcome of a soccer game is thus a classification problem. However, it is a somewhat unusual kind of classification problem in that the three potential outcomes mentioned above have an order to them. This is known as ordinal classification (add link).
